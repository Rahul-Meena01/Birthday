# Birthday wishes

This is a small static birthday wishes page built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Notes:
- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the card locally.
- The project expects a QR image named `QRcode_g1.jpeg` in the project root (or `assets/QRcode_g1.jpeg`) so it can be scanned to view the wishes. Please add your `QRcode_g1.jpeg` file to the repo before publishing, or let me know and I can generate one that points to this GitHub page.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page

Feel free to edit or ask me to add an `assets/` folder and place the QR image there.
